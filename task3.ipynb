    "CLASS:- A class is a user-defined data type that defines a set of attributes and methods that describe the behavior of objects created from it. It acts as a blueprint for creating objects. For example, if you're building a software system for a zoo, you might have a class called \"Animal\" that defines the common characteristics and behaviors of all animals in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "OBJECT:- An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity that can be created, manipulated, and interacted with in your program. Objects have state (values of their attributes) and behavior (implemented through methods). Going back to our zoo example, an object of the \"Animal\" class could be a specific instance of an animal, such as a lion or a giraffe.\n"
